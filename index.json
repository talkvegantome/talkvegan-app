          "rawContent": "\n# If We Didn't Eat Animals They Would Overrun Us Or Go Extinct\n\nOn face value this excuse can seem quite comical but actually I think it’s an excuse that can seem very valid if you don’t know the answer. This excuse is the idea that if we stopped eating animals they would all just be released and cause havoc to our environment, or they’d all be slaughtered and then just discarded.\n\nTo debunk this excuse all we have to do is highlight the fact that animal agriculture works on a system of supply and demand, when we buy products we demand that more be supplied. Farmers only breed as many animals as they can sell, they’re not going to breed more because it quite simply would not be economically viable. Now because the world isn’t going to go vegan overnight and it will instead be a gradual process over a long period, this means that as more and more people go vegan, less and less animals will be bred in proportion with the rise of veganism.\n\nAs the movement continues to grow this pattern will also continue which means that when we eventually end up with a vegan world, farmers simply won’t be breeding animals into production anymore. Consequently, we will never end up with a situation where billions of animals are being released into the wild or taken to the slaughterhouse to be killed and then discarded.\n\nI've even had non-vegans tell me that it isn’t vegan to be vegan because billions of animals would need to be slaughtered, but once we apply the supply and demand logic to this excuse it becomes easy to understand why that statement is entirely disingenuous.\n\nThe conversation will often then go on to the non-vegan arguing that this will mean these animals will go extinct. This is actually quite an interesting argument as obviously the number of these animals will decline exponentially to the point of extinction. Now there’s a couple of ways of looking at this argument: firstly, the animals that we eat and exploit for food are not natural animals, they have all been domesticated, selectively bred and modified in some way that means they were never meant to exist.\n\nDairy cows have been modified to produce up to ten times more milk than they would naturally. Egg-laying hens have been bred to produce up to 300 eggs a year rather than the 10 - 20 they would produce naturally. Broiler chickens have been bred to grow abnormally large at an incredibly quick rate and sheep have been modified to produce more wool than they would naturally and often give birth to more lambs than they would naturally.\n\nBecause of these modifications it’s very unlikely that any of these animals would be able to survive on their own in the wild and as such, they would need humans to care for and look after them. Ultimately, we would really end up with a choice of whether or not we wanted to sustain healthy populations of these animals or whether we think it would be more ethical to allow them to no longer exist and instead replenish our eco-systems with their natural bio-diversity. We would also theoretically be able to reintroduce many of the natural wild animals back into their habitats as we would no longer require such huge expansive areas of land for animal agriculture.\n\nThere would of course still be sanctuaries as well, where rescued animals would be allowed to live their life and there will always be an abundance of people who would be happy to put the time and money into looking after the farmed animals and giving them the care that they need.\n\nI think it’s also important to note that many of these animals are not native to the countries which they are artificially bred in to. For example, sheep are not native to America and shouldn’t be there and unfortunately, it’s the natural wildlife who are then the ones who face the consequences of this as their natural habitat is destroyed in order to make way for farming land. Native wild animals are also often hunted and killed in order to protect the farmer’s flocks.\n\nI think if someone mentions extinction, it’s important to point out that animal agriculture is the leading cause of species extinction - and we are in the largest mass species extinction of the past 65 million years. So if they’re concerned about species extinction, they should really go vegan!\n\n## Source\n\nThis page reproduced verbatim from [30 Non-Vegan Excuses](https://earthlinged.org/ebook) with permission of the author.\n",

          "rawContent": "\n# Our Ancestors Ate Animals / We Evolved by Eating Animals\n\nWhen discussing veganism, one of the strangest yet most commonly used moral justifications for killing animals is that our ancestors used to do it. We often hear people say “you wouldn’t be here if your ancestors didn’t eat meat”, which is not necessarily incorrect but why are we basing our morality on the actions of our ancestors, primitive beings that had no perception of modern day morality and did entirely unethical things such murder and rape without consequence?\n\nSurely if eating is animals is acceptable because cavemen did it, then raping and murdering one another today must also be morally justifiable?\n\nAsk the non-vegan you are talking to, “do you think it is wise to base our morality on the actions of our primitive ancestors?” or, “if it’s morally justifiable to eat animals because our ancestors used to do it, does that not mean that it must also be morally justifiable to murder each other, as our ancestors use to do that as well?”.\n\nIf non-vegans really want to live like their ancestors then they would eat a predominantly vegan diet with the exception of some occasional insects. They would also sleep outside, not use technology, speak in primitive and underdeveloped languages, get overly excited by the creation of fire and have incestuous experiences.\n\nAnother thing people will say similar to the ancestors argument is that “we’ve always eaten meat”. It is such a regressive idea to look into the past for how we should live and basing our actions purely on whether or not we’ve done something for a long period of time is certainly not a good idea, if we did that we would still have slavery and apartheid.\n\nIf anyone ever brings up the argument “we’ve always done it” ask them, “there was a time when treating a woman as less than a man was all we’d ever done, would that make treating a woman as less than a man morally acceptable today?”.\n\nTied in closely with the ancestors argument is the idea that eating meat helped us evolve into the beings that we are today and because of that it is morally justifiable to continue eating animals.\n\nIt is common knowledge and widely accepted that we evolved from primates who survived on a diet comprised predominantly of fruits, nuts, leaves and the occasional insects, but our diets have changed and evolved as the environments we’ve lived in have changed and evolved.\n\nIt is often cited that the reason we are so intelligent now is because we ate meat and many non-vegans claim that it helped us develop and evolve. Even if this is true, it has no relevance to our society today as our brains are not developing every time we eat a big mac, nor are we evolving as a species every time we enter Nando’s. Quite the opposite in fact.\n\nAs explained in the section of this e-book on nutrition, eating animal products is a hinderance to our health, as opposed to being beneficial. Consuming foods that have a negative impact on our health can therefore not be considered helpful to the evolution of our species. Because of eating animal products, we are dying younger than we would be without them.\n\nCouple that with the fact that animal agriculture is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than the entire transportation system combined and is the leading cause of rainforest destruction, oceanic dead zones, species extinction, top soil erosion, land desertification and a whole host of other environmental concerns, it quickly becomes apparent that the future of our evolution depends on us not eating animals. The United Nations has in fact stated that the world needs to shift to a plant- based diet in order to avoid the worst effects of climate change. ([http:// www.cowspiracy.com/facts/](http:// www.cowspiracy.com/facts/) - for all environmental facts)\n\nFurthermore, there are also other theories as to why our brains developed. The first is that we began to eat cooked starchy foods and more carbohydrate dense foods. These starches would have been readily available and with the brain using 60% of the human body’s blood glucose, such high glucose demands would not have been met on a low carbohydrate diet.\n\nAnother idea is that we expanded our consciousness by consuming hallucinogenic mushrooms which allowed us to access parts of our brain previously unexplored, which therefore ultimately made us more self-aware and intelligent.\n\nNow undoubtedly eating animals helped us survive through times of food scarcity but just as the very foundations of much our society was built upon slavery doesn’t justify slavery in today’s world, the fact that eating animals helped us get to this point or helped us survive in the past, doesn’t justify eating animals in today’s world.\n\nIn contemporary society we don’t need to eat animals or their secretions and in doing so we are shortening our lifespan, destroying our planet and causing an unimaginable amount of unnecessary harm to innocent, living beings.\n\n## Source\n\nThis page reproduced verbatim from [30 Non-Vegan Excuses](https://earthlinged.org/ebook) with permission of the author.\n",

          "rawContent": "\n# Eating Animals For Tradition \u0026 Culture\n\nIt is true we have been eating animals for many centuries, but does the longevity of something justify its continuation and existence? Is the excuse, “eating animals is a tradition” a valid justification for not becoming vegan?\n\nLet’s just consider that slavery was once considered a tradition, as was treating a woman as less than a man - but does the fact that these things were once traditional justify them? I think (and hope) most of us would say no. If humanity had gone through history too stubborn and ignorant to change because of so called tradition then we would never have evolved or adapted.\n\nWhat about female genital mutilation? It’s been performed on women for centuries, it’s deep rooted in tradition and yet it is abhorrent. However, using the justification that eating animals is acceptable because it is traditional then means that performing female genital mutilation is therefore acceptable as well. You see, the logic here is extremely flawed as both acts are absolutely horrific and the excuse of tradition serves in no way as any kind of justification for them.\n\nTo apply this argument to another scenario where non-human animals are the ones affected, bullfighting is very much considered a tradition as is the slaughter of dolphins in Taiji, but does that mean that these things should still continue?\n\nThe Yulin Dog Meat Festival and the Boknal Dog Meat Festival are both annual events where thousands of dogs and cats are killed and eaten, they are both traditional events and yet throughout the western world we voice our disgust at these festivals. When people bring up tradition as a justification to eat animals, I like to ask: “The Yulin dog meat festival is traditional, does that make it okay to butcher and kill dogs and cats?”.\n\nIn terms of cultural identity - why should we celebrate culture with the slaughter of innocent beings when we can honour different cultures and areas of life through music, dance and language? Why is the unifying factor that binds all of humanity together the consumption of animals and not the universal acknowledgement that we are all brothers and sisters, creatures of this earth who are united by sharing one planet? Not the same but equal.\n\nCultural tradition cements us in our past transgressions. If humanity is to ever evolve past abusing animals, we need to erase all concepts of tradition, for tradition is the construct of ego, passed on by generations to eradicate and deter the threat of change. Tradition has never and will never be a valid excuse for the acts we have committed as a species and especially not for the continued murder and consumption of sentient life.\n\nIn a situation where a non-vegan uses tradition as an excuse ask them:\n\n“Is female genital mutilation morally justifiable because it is a tradition?”.\n\n“Is the slaughter of dolphins in Japan morally justifiable because it is traditional?” “Is bullfighting morally justifiable because it’s part of culture and tradition?”\n\n“With these in mind, do you think culture and tradition are good indicators for our morality?”\n\n## Source\n\nThis page reproduced verbatim from [30 Non-Vegan Excuses](https://earthlinged.org/ebook) with permission of the author.\n",

However the majority of people truly believe that animal products contain nutritional elements that we cannot get elsewhere and that we need for our health and longevity, after all, there has to be a real reason why we’re doing all of these horrific things to animals, right?\n\nThe main nutritional factors that come up in conversations with non-vegans are protein, iron, calcium and if they’re a bit more clued up, B12. I would strongly recommend watching and memorising the points in these four videos by Bite Size Vegan and M.D Michael Greger.\n\n1. Protein: Dr Michael Greger of nutritionfacts.org\n2. Iron: Dr. Michael Greger of nutritionfacts.org\n3. Calcium: Dr. Michael Greger of nutritionfacts.org\n4. B12: Dr. Michael Greger of nutritionfacts.org\u2028\n\nYou can quite easily shut a non-vegan down in an argument about nutrition by explaining to them that The American Dietetic Association and the British Dietetic Association, the largest bodies of nutrition and diet professionals in both countries, have both stated that a plant-based (vegan) diet is nutritionally adequate and safe for all stages of life, including pregnancy. Meaning that we can officially get all the nutrients we need without eating animals or their secretions. Protein, iron, calcium and every other nutrient that we associate with animal products can be obtained easily without the need for exploiting animals.\n\nThe largest and strongest land animals in the world, the elephant, the rhino, the hippopotamus, what do they all have in common? They are all plant eaters. But does anyone think an elephant is protein deficient, or that a rhino has weak bones?\n\nWhat about a gorilla, humans share approximately 98% of our DNA with gorillas and they are herbivorous. But how many protein deficient gorillas do we see? Why would animals that have almost the same DNA as us but that are also much stronger than we are, be able to get all the nutrients they need from plants, if we humans can’t?\n\nIn fact, consuming animal products has been linked to our top diseases and illnesses. Heart disease, type-2 diabetes, many forms of cancer, strokes, hypertension, dementia and osteoporosis have all been inextricably linked to the consumption of animal products and many of them can be treated and even reversed by switching to a plant- based lifestyle. Recommend that the non-vegan watches ‘Uprooting the Leading Causes of Death’ (YouTube) and ‘What the Health’ (Netflix).\n\nThere are an abundance of plant-based athletes across the world including Germany’s strongest man Patrick Baboumian, NFL players such as David Carter and weightlifters such as Kendrick Farris and boxers like David Haye. You can reference these athletes in your conversation with non-vegans.\n\nAsk the non-vegan if there is any necessity for us to eat animals and their secretions, to which they cannot logically reply to with “yes” after receiving the information above about nutrition. Then say to them “does this not therefore mean that doing these things to animals is an act of unnecessary cruelty?”.\n\n## Source\n\nThis page reproduced verbatim from [30 Non-Vegan Excuses](https://earthlinged.org/ebook) with permission of the author.\n",

          "rawContent": "\n# Other Animals Eat Other Animals\n\nWhen confronted with the idea that the consumption of animals is done purely for the taste rather than for nutrition (see nutrition) one of the most common excuses vegans hear is, “but animals eat other animals, so why shouldn’t we?”\n\nAs much as this may be true, some animals do indeed eat other animals, there’s many reasons as to why this statement holds no veracity whatsoever.\n\nWe need only first consider the anatomical biology of omnivores compared to that of humans. Firstly, omnivores have sharp claws and huge fangs compared to our hands and blunt, ineffective canines. When was the last time you saw a human running on all fours ripping the flesh off a living animal? Omnivores also have short intestines, ideal for digesting flesh, whilst humans have incredibly long intestines, which are useless at digesting flesh - hence the constipation and colon cancer! The acid contained within omnivore and carnivore stomachs is very strong hydrochloric acid, ideal for the digestion of raw animal flesh, which when compared to the weak acid found in our stomachs, explains why we are susceptible to food poisoning from undercooked meat.\n\nYou don’t see a lion checking to make sure their dinner is cooked through all the way to the middle. You also don’t see a lion being picky about which part of an animal they should eat, but how often do we see stories in the newspaper of the shocking revelation that a brain was found in a piece of KFC? It’s like for that split second the illusion that meat doesn’t come from a living, breathing, feeling animal is shattered and people are forced to confront the abject reality of where their food comes from. A real omnivore isn’t disgusted by the gore.\n\nLet’s consider this, if you were locked in a room with a live chicken and an apple you would always eat the apple first. Because when we see a living being we don’t feel hungry, we don’t want to ravage animals and tear them apart - but when we see an apple we do feel hungry.\n\nFurthermore, even though certain animals eat other animals, there are many more herbivorous animals than there are carnivorous ones. But regardless, what exactly is the relevance of what other animals do when applied to human behaviour? Some animals rape and kill each other, so does that mean humans would be excused if they committed these acts too? Ask that question to the non-vegan who is using the excuse, say “wild animals kill each other, does that mean it is morally justifiable for humans to kill each other just because some wild animals do?”.\n\nFurthermore, lions have been documented killing their own cubs before, so using non-vegan logic it must therefore be acceptable for humans to kill their children as other animals have been shown to do so. In this situation ask the non-vegan “do you think it is wise to base our morality on that of a wild animal?”.\n\nAnimals also kill their food themselves, they don’t pay others to kill on their behalf because they find the prospect of slaughtering an animal too traumatising. If we were naturally designed to eat meat we would have no objection to killing animals. We also wouldn’t shelter the truth from our children and yet we deem the reality of slaughterhouses to be too troubling and disturbing for a child.\n\nOther animals kill out of necessity whereas humans do not, in fact eating animals is incredibly detrimental to our health. Humans kill other animals because we enjoy the way they taste, meaning we kill them for pleasure, even though this goes against many of our core morals. Many of us oppose animal exploitation when it comes to things like dog fighting or hunting as they are seen as unnecessary and only done for pleasure and yet can’t see that eating animals is also unnecessary and only done for pleasure. It’s important to try and get people to make this connection so you can also ask the non-vegan “are you an obligate carnivore?” and then say “if you don’t have to eat meat then why do you do so?”. If they say it’s because they like the taste, then ask “are your tastebuds more important than a life?”. As you can see, the circle of excuses tends to go round like a revolving door!\n\nIt is so unbelievably ironic that we deem ourselves so incredibly superior to animals (see intelligence), but when the superiority argument no longer functions as an effective excuse for murdering living beings, we suddenly portray ourselves as just a wild animal acting out our primal instincts.\n\nSo what are we, better than animals, or only animals? We can’t be both.\n\n## Source\n\nThis page reproduced verbatim from [30 Non-Vegan Excuses](https://earthlinged.org/ebook) with permission of the author.\n",

          "rawContent": "\n\n# I like the Taste \u0026 I couldn't give it up\n\n\nWhen it boils down to it, the number one reason people eat animal products is because they enjoy the taste - I know I certainly did, in fact like most people I loved the taste of animal products. I think one of the most disconcerting things about the taste excuse though, is that it is an excuse that bluntly admits that the personal desires of an individual’s taste preference matter more than the morality surrounding an animal’s life and unquestionably horrific death.\n\n However, it doesn’t mean that the person using this excuse necessarily believes that their taste preferences are more important than an animal’s life (most people I talk to don’t) but because they’ve never been asked about it before they’ve never had to confront the fact that through their actions they are placing their taste higher. This is why when people say to me “I love the taste of meat.” or, “I could never give up cheese.”, I like to ask them “do you value your taste buds higher than the life of an animal?” - most people will say no, but if they do say yes make sure to ask them why.\n\nOne of the big issues with this excuse is that it seeks to validate a non-vegan diet by claiming that we shouldn’t be held responsible for our immoral activities because our selfish impulses are too strong to be suppressed and as such, we can’t be held morally accountable for the actions that we make.\n\nBut where do we draw the line? Would this argument hold up in court if a murderer in their own defence said, “but I could never give up murdering because I enjoy it too much.”?\n\nIt requires more than sensory pleasure to morally justify something - and the inconvenience people go through by giving up cheese, for example, is not even remotely comparable to the pain a dairy cow goes through being forcibly impregnated repeatedly, having her children taken away from her and being painfully pumped for her milk before she becomes too weak and is sent off to be slaughtered.\n\nI think one of the reasons why as vegans we find this excuse a really difficult one to hear is because it doesn’t matter whatever product people claim they could never give up or enjoy the taste of, the difficulty and the inconvenience that it would be for them to no longer eat animal products is minuscule compared to the pain, suffering and fear that the animals have to go through.\n\nA non-vegan meal lasts for 15 minutes, but the death of an animal is eternal. What food could ever be worth taking the life of an individual? An individual that felt fear, an individual that felt pain, an individual that felt confused and couldn’t understand why such intolerable suffering was being committed against them?\n\nThe fear of death is not unique to humans. Most of us fear dying and hope it will happen peacefully, surrounded by the ones we love without pain. The scariest thing we can think of is being tortured and ultimately murdered. We make horror films about this concept and it gives us nightmares. But this isn’t a horror film for the trillions of animals that are slaughtered each year, it isn’t some nightmare that they will wake from. It’s real, the pain, the fear, it is all real - and then they die and they are gone forever.\n\nWe need only put ourselves in the position of the animals, as they look up at the human who’s about to murder them and imagine their fear and confusion, to understand why taste can never justify this incomprehensible atrocity. When talking to someone who uses the excuse of taste, ask them the following questions:\n\n“Do you not think we require more than sensory pleasure alone to morally justify an action?.\n\n“Is it morally justifiable for someone to kill a dog if they like the taste?”\n\n“What is it about being human that means the life of an animal is lower than our taste preferences?”\n\n“Do you think it is acceptable to inflict pain, suffering and death on to an animal that wishes to avoid pain, suffering and death?”\n\n“If we would hate to be exploited and killed, is it not hypocritical for us to exploit and kill others?”\n\nAlso, remember to explain that it’s not as if people even have to give up the flavours of the animal products that they eat. There is now such a huge and varied selection of vegan alternatives to cheese, milk, eggs and meats. Explain that as vegans we eat burgers, hot dogs, burritos, nachos, lasagna, mac and cheese, curries, cheese pizza, cakes, cupcakes, cheesecakes, cookies, ice cream and everything else in between.\n\nExplain how as vegans we experience all of the flavours and textures that we used to, except now they’re made from plants. No dead body parts, no gristle, no cholesterol, no hormones, no antibiotics. It’s also really helpful to tell them where they can get these products from, so for example here in the UK, Sainsbury’s and Tesco have their own range of vegan cheese and you can get meat alternatives in nearly every supermarket.\n\nI also think it can be worth highlighting which restaurants now have vegan menus and options, again just to make veganism seem as easy and accessible as possible. Some great examples of places in the UK are: Wagamama, Zizzi, Pizza Express, Nando’s, Pizza Hut, GBK, Wetherspoons, Pret A Manger, All Bar One and Carluccio’s.\n\n## Source  \n\nThis page reproduced verbatim from [30 Non-Vegan Excuses](https://earthlinged.org/ebook) with permission of the author.\n",

So is eating animals a personal choice or is it a little more complex than that?\n\nThis is quite an interesting excuse as arguably it is a choice, one does actively choose to eat dead flesh and animal secretions, the same way that a racist actively chooses to be racist or a rapist actively chooses to commit rape. Using this logic it would then be morally justifiable to beat a dog or kick a cat, as it is a personal choice to do so. In this situation ask the person, “if someone makes the personal choice to abuse a dog, does that make it morally justifiable?”.\n\nThe problem is when non-vegans use this argument they have either become so detached from the fact that their animal products came from a living being, or they hold animals with such little regard that they don't consider the lives of their food worthy of contemplation because they think the consumption of animal products only affects them as individuals.\n\nSo when a vegan seeks to educate a non-vegan we are met with “you should respect other people's points of view”. However, as vegans we do respect the views of others. We respect the views of the 56 billion land animals murdered each year that didn't want to die. We respect the views of the dairy cows and egg-laying hens whose bodies are sexually abused and exploited and treated as nothing other than a disposable commodity.\n\nWe respect the views of the 2 - 2.7 trillion fish and marine animals that are dragged out of their natural habitat every year and suffocated or crushed to death.\n\nWe respect the views of animals skinned alive for their fur or abused, tortured and killed for their skin, wool and feathers. We respect the views of the animals callously tested on by scientists and cosmetics companies, confined to a life of agony and unbelievable pain.\n\nWe respect the views of the animals beaten and punished to perform circus tricks and unnatural behaviours for our entertainment. We respect the views of every animal that is oppressed, tortured and murdered.\n\nWe respect the views of the humans who are also victims within our systems of animal exploitation - and we even respect the view of the person we are talking to, the view that they probably want to live a long life by caring enough to tell them that consuming animal products hugely increases their risk of cancer, diabetes, strokes, dementia, heart disease and every other major disease plaguing our species.\n\nSo when people so defiantly tell us to respect the views of others, the question is, which other view point are they considering other than their own?\n\nWhen they declare it's their personal choice to eat animal products, what about the personal choice of every other creature, human and non-human alike, whose life is treated as inferior and meaningless just so people can poison their bodies with products created from their death and fear?\n\nIt is not morally justifiable to murder just because the murderer personally made the choice to murder. It is not morally justifiable to rape just because the rapist personally made the choice to commit the act of rape. It is not morally justifiable to kick and beat a dog just because the abuser personally made the choice to kick and beat the dog and it is not morally justifiable to pay for animals to be exploited and killed, just because a non-vegan personally made the choice to pay for animals to be exploited and killed.\n\nWhen someone uses the “my personal choice” argument, simply ask them “what about the personal choice of the animal who wants to live, have you considered their choice?”.\n\n## Source\n\nThis page reproduced verbatim from [30 Non-Vegan Excuses](https://earthlinged.org/ebook) with permission of the author.\n",
